# Personal Project: Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This project showcases my work on a data analysis and machine learning task originally structured as an academic assignment. I have adapted it into a personal project to demonstrate my skills in Python, data preprocessing, visualization, and model building using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Visualization of data distributions and relationships
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Performance comparison and conclusions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
